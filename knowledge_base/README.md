# Knowledge Base

This directory contains our philosophical knowledge system.  
The structure here is intentionally **flat** — all notes live in a single layer without sub‑folders. This keeps linking easy and improves Obsidian graph navigation.

## How to Work With This Folder

- Every file should be an **atomic note** about an author, movement, concept, book, or period.
- Notes should be created **only using templates** from `templates/` to keep metadata consistent across the vault.
- Files should be named clearly (e.g., `kant.md`, `stoicism.md`, `will-to-power.md`) so the graph remains readable.

## Templates

Use the following templates when creating new notes:

### `author.md`
For philosophers and key thinkers.  
Includes metadata, major works, movements, and Dataview tables.

### `movement.md`
For philosophical schools or traditions.  
Captures principles, historical context, key authors, and linked works.

### `book.md`
For philosophical works.  
Summaries, key ideas, quotes, discussion notes, and Dataview references.

### `concept.md`
The core of the system — atomic ideas.  
Contains definitions, explanations, context, criticism, and links to authors/movements/books.

### `period.md`
For historical eras.  
Includes timeframe, intellectual characteristics, authors, movements, and Dataview listings.

## Why This Matters

Keeping all notes flat + using standardized templates ensures:

- easy search and navigation  
- consistent metadata for Dataview  
- a clean Obsidian graph  
- predictable linking between ideas, authors, and eras

This directory is the long‑term philosophical memory of our book club — use it to capture insights, connect concepts, and build a living network of understanding.
