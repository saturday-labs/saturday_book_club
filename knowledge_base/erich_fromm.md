# Erich Fromm

---

## Short Description

Erich Fromm was a German-American social psychologist, philosopher, and representative of humanistic psychoanalysis.
He combined a psychoanalytic approach with sociology, ethics, and critical theory of society.
Fromm explored the nature of human freedom, mechanisms of escape from it, the structure of character, and the root causes of social alienation.
His works focused on the search for an authentic, "vibrant" life, which is opposed to the materialistic state of "being".

## Context & Influence

- He was educated in Germany during the formation of the Frankfurt School and actively interacted with Adorno, Gorkheimer, and Marcuse.
- He was a critic of orthodox Freudianism, proposing to consider a person not only through the prism of sexual instincts, but also through social structures and character.
- He influenced the development of humanistic psychology and post-Freudian trends, becoming a bridge between psychoanalysis, philosophy, and sociology.

## Criticism

- Some consider his concepts too abstract, with insufficient empirical verification (especially "social character" and "existential orientation").
- The philosophical community sometimes criticizes him for eclecticism: the combination of Freudianism, Marxism, existentialism and humanism is not always consistent.
- Representatives of the Frankfurt School, with whom he worked earlier, considered his research too "psychologized" and departed from his methods.
