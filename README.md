## Saturday Book Club

This repository keeps our book-club logistics, reading pipeline, and meeting history in one place.

### Folder Map

- `books/` — track everything we're reading.
  - [`to-read.md`](books/to-read.md) keeps nominations and links.
  - [`in-progress.md`](books/in-progress.md) notes current assignments.
  - [`completed.md`](books/completed.md) stores takeaways when we finish a book.
- `meetings/` — agendas and recaps for every session. Start from [`template.md`](meetings/template.md) and keep dated notes next to it.
- `notes/` — deeper reflections or chapter summaries. Use [`templates/book-notes-template.md`](notes/templates/book-notes-template.md) when starting a new note.

### How We Use It

1. Nominate a title by adding it to `books/to-read.md` with a short note.
2. Once the group picks it, move it to `books/in-progress.md` and assign facilitators per session.
3. After finishing, summarize key insights in `books/completed.md` and store any long-form notes under `notes/`.
4. For each gathering, copy `meetings/template.md` into `meetings/YYYY-MM-DD.md`, fill in the agenda, and capture action items.

Keeping these files up to date gives everyone a quick snapshot of what we're reading, what's next, and what we've learned together.
