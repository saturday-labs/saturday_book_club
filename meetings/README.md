# Meeting Notes

Store an agenda and recap for every meeting. Use ISO dates in filenames (e.g., `2024-06-15.md`) so everything stays sorted. Each file should include:

1. Agenda / chapters to cover
2. Discussion prompts or open questions
3. Decisions and action items (who buys next book, next host, etc.)
